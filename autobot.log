==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall bison`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because some formulae require a newer version of bison.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/bison/lib
