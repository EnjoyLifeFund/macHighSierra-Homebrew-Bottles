==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall m4`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/m4/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
