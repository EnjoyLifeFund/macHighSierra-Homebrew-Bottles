==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall qt`
==> Caveats
We agreed to the Qt opensource license for you.
If this is unacceptable you should uninstall.

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because Qt 5 has CMake issues when linked.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/qt/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/qt/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/qt/lib/pkgconfig
