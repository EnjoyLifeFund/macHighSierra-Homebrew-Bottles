==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall cython`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this formula is mainly used internally by other formulae.
Users are advised to use `pip` to install cython.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/cython/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
