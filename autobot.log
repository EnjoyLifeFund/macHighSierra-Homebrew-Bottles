==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig


If you need Python to find bindings for this keg-only formula, run:
  echo /usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libxml2.pth
  mkdir -p /Users/dojo/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /Users/dojo/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth
