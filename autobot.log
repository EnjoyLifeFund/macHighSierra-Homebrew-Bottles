==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall lapack`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/lapack/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/lapack/lib/pkgconfig
