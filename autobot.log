You can run it manually using `brew postinstall jpeg-turbo`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because libjpeg-turbo is not linked to prevent conflicts with the standard libjpeg.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/jpeg-turbo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/jpeg-turbo/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/jpeg-turbo/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/jpeg-turbo/lib/pkgconfig
