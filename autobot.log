==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.28_1 --program-prefix=g --without-gmp
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall coreutils`
==> Caveats
All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.

If you really need to use these commands with their normal names, you
can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:

    PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:

    MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
