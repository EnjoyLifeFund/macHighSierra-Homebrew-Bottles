==> Reinstalling zlib 
==> Downloading https://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz
==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.11
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall zlib`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/zlib/lib/pkgconfig

==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.11: 12 files, 373.5KB, built in 2 minutes 17 seconds
