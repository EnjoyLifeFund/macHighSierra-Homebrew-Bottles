==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/make/4.2.1_1 --program-prefix=g
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall make`
==> Caveats
All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.
If you do not want the prefix, install using the "with-default-names" option.

If you need to use these commands with their normal names, you
can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:

    PATH="/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:

    MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
